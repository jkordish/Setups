Relatively simple setup to enable a local DHCP server with dynamic DNS updates for a lab domain.

# Tested and implemented on OpenBSD 5.1.

# Instructions

The shipped DHCPD server does not support ddns so we must install the ISC-DHCPD one.

    bash-4.2# pkg_add -r ftp://mirror.esc7.net/pub/OpenBSD/5.1/packages/i386/isc-dhcp-server-4.2.3.2.tgz

You can verify that you installed it.

    bash-4.2# pkg_info -a

        isc-dhcp-server-4.2.3.2 ISC DHCP Server

Create some additional NAMED files for logs.
    
    bash-4.2# touch /var/named/named.run

    bash-4.2# touch /var/named/named_query.log

    bash-4.2# touch /var/named/named_dump.db

    bash-4.2# chown named:named /var/named/named.run

    bash-4.2# chown named:named /var/named/named_query.log

    bash-4.2# chown named:named /var/named/named_dump.db

You will want to change the permission since we are running as user NAMED.

    bash-4.2# chown named:named /var/named/master

    bash-4.2# chgrp named /var/named/etc

    bash-4.2# chown named:named /var/named/etc/*


Ensure your permissions for /var/named/ are correct. The following are what mine look like.
###### you may not have some of the db. files just yet.

    bash-4.2# ls -l /var/named/

        drwxr-xr-x  2 root   wheel      512 Jul 12 07:21 dev

        -rw-r--r--  1 named  named  3110 Feb 12 10:32 root.hint

    bash-4.2# ls -l /var/named/etc/master/

        -rw-r--r--  1 named  named   794 Jul 13 06:26 db.10.120.10

Edit your /etc/dhcpd.conf file ensuring you are setting up DDNS correctly. Mine can be found here.

Next edit your /var/named/named.conf. Once again, mine can be found here for reference.

Change the daemon in /etc/rc.d/dhcpd to point to /usr/local/sbin/dhcpd
###### I think this isn't the right way to do it since it may not stay during updates to the base os.

    bash-4.2# sed -i 's/\/usr\/sbin\/dhcpd/\/usr\/local\/sbin\/dhcpd/' /etc/rc.d/dhcpd

Add both DHCPD and NAMED to your /etc/rc.conf.local file for startup.

    bash-4.2# echo 'dhcpd_flags=""' >> /etc/rc.conf.local

    bash-4.2# echo 'named_flags="-u named -d 3"' >> /etc/rc.conf.local

Now start both daemons. Hopefully they start...

    bash-4.2# /etc/rc.d/dhcpd start

    bash-4.2# /etc/rc.d/named start
